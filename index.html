              <em><strong>Jiraiya</strong></em>
              (自来也) was one of Konohagakure's Sannin. Famed as a hermit and
              pervert of stupendous ninja skill, Jiraiya travelled the world in
              search of knowledge that would help his friends, the various novels
              he wrote, and, posthumously, the world in its entirety – knowledge
              that would be passed on to his godson and final student, Naruto
              Uzumaki.

            <h3><strong>From his Childhood</strong></h3>
            <img class="image-left" src="images/Team_hiruzen.PNG" alt="Gaddafi with child on his lap">
            <p>
              After he graduated from Konoha's Ninja Academy, Jiraiya was teamed
              with Orochimaru and Tsunade under the leadership of Hiruzen Sarutobi.
              Hiruzen gave them a bell test for the team's first exercise, during
              which Jiraiya repeatedly fell for Hiruzen's tricks, and for failing
              to acquire a bell, he was tied to a stump as punishment. Hiruzen
              encouraged Jiraiya to be more like Orochimaru, but Jiraiya countered
              that his Transparent Escape Technique was a fair testament to his
              skills, as he could spy on bathing women without getting caught:
              Hiruzen offered to accompany him to see if this was true. Jiraiya
              had a certain interest in Tsunade from their first meeting, and
              when her breasts developed, she became a frequent target of his
              peepings. She nearly killed him when she caught him on one occasion,
              forcing him to be more discreet about his interests.

            <p>
              Jiraiya at some point discovered Mount Myōboku, the residence of
              the toads; in the anime, he was brought there when he tried to
              summon a toad without first having a contract with them.
              Fukasaku trained Jiraiya in their ways, most prominently senjutsu.
              While he was at Mount Myōboku, the Great Toad Sage made a prediction
              about Jiraiya: that he would travel the world and during that time
              meet the Child of the Prophecy, a student who would grow up to either
              save or destroy the world depending upon how Jiraiya taught them.
            </p>
            <img class="image-left" src="images/Team_jiraiya.png" alt="Team Jiraiya">
            <p>
              At some point Jiraiya was made a jōnin and lead a genin team of his
              own. He started to suspect that one of them, Minato Namikaze, might
              be the Child of the Prophecy because of his natural genius. As such,
              he took Minato as his disciple and taught him many of his skills;
              Minato would eventually teach Jiraiya the Rasengan. Gutsy Shinobi
              did not sell well when it was released. Eventually, Jiraiya found
              his writing style when he created the adult novels called Icha Icha.
              The novels were based on his personal experiences in love - particularly
              his rejections by Tsunade - retold in a comical way. The books were wildly
              popular, giving his chequebook a balance that is "filled with zeroes".

            <img class="image-right" src="images/Hanzo_and_Sannin.png" alt="Hanzo and sannin">
            <p>Although their team under Hiruzen's leadership had disbanded,
              Jiraiya, Orochimaru, and Tsunade continued fighting together during
              the Second Shinobi World War. During one such fight in Amegakure,
              they were the only three to survive an encounter with Hanzō, for
              which accomplishment Hanzō dubbed them Konoha's "Legendary Sannin".
              After the battle, three war orphans approached them and asked to be
              taught ninjutsu. Jiraiya, guilty for his involvement in the war,
              decided to stay in Ame for a time in order to look after them.
              Shortly after he joined them, he discovered that one of the orphans,
              Nagato, possessed the Rinnegan, once used by the Sage of the Six
              Paths to save the world. Jiraiya decided that Nagato was the Child
              of the Prophecy, and as such agreed to teach the orphans ninjutsu
              so that he might guide Nagato towards the world's salvation.
            </p>
            <img class="image-left" src="images/Naruto_smilling.jfif" alt="Naruto smilling">
            <p>
              Nagato was a kind child, torn between his desire to not hurt others
              and his wish to protect Yahiko and Konan. Jiraiya comforted Nagato
              that it was enough to want to protect people one holds to be important,
              as the world is plagued with seemingly endless conflict. Nagato decided
              that it was possible to end the constant bloodshed and, though he didn't
              know how, that he would someday find the path to peace. Jiraiya was
              inspired by Nagato's words and started writing what would become
              The Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi. After three years of training
              the orphans, Jiraiya decided they were ready to forge out on their
              own and he returned to Konoha; he left them a finished copy of Gutsy
              Shinobi, dedicated to Nagato.[18] News of the orphans' deeds would
              reach him from time to time, but eventually he heard that they'd all died.

            <h3>Minato became the Fourth Hokage</h3>
            <img class="image-right" src="images/Minato_becomes_hokage.png" alt="Minato becomes Hokage">
            <p>
              <strong>Minato</strong> - selected as Konoha's Fourth Hokage after Jiraiya refused
              the position - enjoyed the book, finding the main character very
              much like Jiraiya. He decided to name his and Kushina Uzumaki's
              then-unborn son "Naruto" after the main character, hoping that
              their Naruto would be just as determined as the character (and
              thus its author). Jiraiya tried to convince them not to since
              that would make him Naruto's godfather, but Minato and Kushina
              insisted this was a good thing. Minato died during the Nine-Tailed
              Demon Fox's Attack, giving his life to seal the Nine-Tails into
              the newborn Naruto; as one of his last acts, Minato sent Jiraiya
              Gerotora, on whose stomach he wrote the key to Naruto's seal.
              Jiraiya guessed that Minato wanted him to help Naruto gain control
              of the Nine-Tails' power, though he couldn't guess what that power
              would be needed for.

            <h3>Jiraiya's closest friend Orochimaru</h3>
            <img class="image-left"src="images/orochimaru.jpg" alt="Orochimaru'picture">
            <p>
              Although Orochimaru had always been his better, someone that
              Hiruzen pointed to as an example for Jiraiya to live up to,
              Jiraiya considered Orochimaru to be one of his closest friends.
              For this reason, when Orochimaru eventually defected from Konoha,
              Jiraiya pursued him and tried to convince him to return. Orochimaru
              refused and attacked Jiraiya in order to secure his escape. For
              a time, Jiraiya tried to find a deeper meaning in Orochimaru's
              betrayal, something that, if changed, would bring Orochimaru back.
              He could ultimately come up with nothing. From that point onward,
              Jiraiya started following Orochimaru's movements as well as those
              of Akatsuki, an organisation which Orochimaru eventually joined.
              His investigations often took him away from the village, preventing
              Jiraiya from becoming Fifth Hokage like Hiruzen wanted him to.

            <h3>Appearnce</h3>
            <img class="image-right"src="images/Jiraiya_full2.png" alt="">
            <p>
              Jiraiya was a tall and well-built man in adulthood with fair skin.
              He had waist-length, spiky white hair that he usually ties back
              into a pony tail, with two shoulder-length bangs framing his face.
              There were red lines under his eyes which extended further down
              his face as he got older, going all the way to the bottom by the
              time he was an adult. By the time he was middle-aged, he developed
              wrinkles around the corners of his mouth and a wart on the left
              side of his nose. Following an encounter with Naruto's Version 2
              form, he received a large scar on his chest. His usual attire
              consisted of a green short shirt kimono and matching pants, under
              which he wore mesh armour that is visible at his wrists and ankles.
              He also wore hand guards, a black belt, traditional Japanese wooden
              sandals, and a red haori with two yellow circles on each side. He
              often carried a large scroll on his back, and had a tattoo on his
              left palm, and he wore a horned forehead protector with the kanji
              for "oil" (油, abura), which denoted his affiliation with Mount Myōboku.
